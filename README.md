# PortalToTruth (also old coder learning GitHub with little reference to documentation (no videos); feel it out - with a little JavaScript as the initial focus for many reasons) 
Covering 400 years of U.S. history with a minimal approach, tech and biz.

For now, see https://tgsoc.org for the operational site. What pends discussion will be expanding biz and tech. The former will help manage the non-profit as well as access, etc. The latter is open ended, right now mapping to a WordPress blog. 

See https://tgsoc.org/tech/2019/08/09/home-at-last/ for a continuation of a theme that is several years old relating to modern issues of content management. What did GitHub (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) look like in 2012? Doesn't matter, as code was not the focus. Content was. I pulled together a mishmash using HTML that kept me working, almost, as in aspx.net. Before long, I was looking for alternatives. Still am, however, I am an old roll-your-own'er. So, it is imperative that I give that a chance in this new world of people making offerings that are more 'trojan horse' than not. Discussion: https://tgsoc.org/demo/demo.html. I have old posts on Google/Blogger that I need to pull forward.
