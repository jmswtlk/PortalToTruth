# PortalToTruth (also old coder learning GitHub without little reference to documentation (no videos); feel it out - with little JavaScript as the focus for many reasons) 
Covering 400 years of U.S. history with a minimal approach, tech and biz.

For now, see https://tgsoc.org for the operational site. What pends discussion will be expanding biz and tech. The former will help manage the non-profit as well as access, etc. The latter is open ended, right now mapping to a WordPress blog. 

See https://tgsoc.org/tech/2019/08/09/home-at-last/ for a continuation of a theme that is several years old relating to modern issues of content management. What did GitHub (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) look like in 2012? Doesn't matter, as code was not the focus. Content was. I pulled together a mishmash using HTML that kept me working, almost, as in aspx.net. Before long, I was looking for alternatives. Still am, however, I am an old roll-your-own'er. So, it is imperative that I give that a chance in this new world of people making offerings that are more 'trojan horse' than not. Discussion: https://tgsoc.org/demo/demo.html. I have old posts on Google/Blogger that I need to pull forward.  

--- Will log here until I see how to do it better ---

1 - Uploaded the JS files. 
Now, see how to update and sync changes here at the FTP site. 
2 - First branch and update. Now do a pull. Several other updates pending. 
3 - Brought in more files. Like the interface. Got a project page started. 
Also, will be using Wiki (to have something familiar - have been hackign with textual editors primarily - content was the focus). 
4 - With a better view than the little text window, I can see more noise put in. Interesting. 
5 - Disclosure: my purpose was content which covered centuries along all sorts of threads. The computing aspects were considered secondary since information was the intent.  

6 - Stopped to look at templates. Of course, ran into these when I was doing my occasional review of possible techniques. But, content was my focus at each of those points. Though, I did spend a summer doing a little codecademy every day, did all of their lessons at the time, while doing so opinionated about the experiment, wondered about the motivation behind some of those, they have proliferated madly, ..., mad house, anyone?, ..., even saw reference to the 'floor' which i'll go into further, artistic/technical, one split, sure, it's presentation versus compute, some trying to split, i say, parametric versus algorithmic, i see css as a huge parametric set, will go into this, ..., as mentioned was using Sea Monkey Composer, even Wordpad, and Notepad, ..., eventually let Chrome's tools do their thing, ..., btw, not only minimal in terms of resource, i've been working without ide support, down and dirty with the text, ...

7 - so, no confusion about details (know one, know them all, essentially), but went and searched on motivation for javascript templates, i'm always asking why? (it's not enough to say, money, power, etc. -- we're in a mess, people), up pops the discussion, hearing from those on both sides, and then see 'dust' (someone always does it right) as being in the middle, remember 'floor' in the future, for all computing levels we have this bifurcation, some try to bridge as i have the past ten years doing everything, at least, i know enough to know where i'm deficit, ..., yet, perfection?, let's discuss that as one manufacturer who touts this (their mantra of is no failure is way beyond six sigma), has let software and its complexity get the better of their process with recent failures in a hugely public and tragic sense (think, falling out of the sky), ..., come one, people, we need to step back a decade and one-half and review what all of this endless permutation has wrought
8 - also, i may be new to github in the sense of having an account, i'm no newbie to computing having watched, and participated in, its evolution, up close, for decades, in the trenches, not in academia, though i have worked with very many academics who stooped to see what we real-world people were up to, ..., more, ...,
