              children of Thomas Gardner, and Margaret Fryer,<small><sup>1</sup></small>
              eight had progeny. The first four got through their first
              year and beyond.<small><sup>2</sup></small> Then, after
              1627, the family was in the Naukeag area (which became
              Salem). Let's look at the last three of the children (see
              Roll): Thomas, George, and Seeth.<small><sup>3</sup></small>

                <i><b>Thomas Gardner</b></i> (c. 1620s), born in
                England, he came to Cape Ann with his folks.&nbsp;
                Thomas (and brother John) had a good reputation on
                Nantucket. They were noted to have been educated which
                did not come from Harvard. The best guess? Their
                parents, especially Margaret.<small><sup>4</sup></small>
                <br>
                <i><b>George Gardner</b></i> (c. 1620s), born in
                England, he came to Cape Ann with his folks. The story
                of George and his family is told in the 1933 book by
                Frank A. Gardner, M.S. titled <i>Gardner Memorial</i> <small><sup>5</sup></small><br>
                <i><b>Seeth Gardner</b></i> (c. 1630s) was born in Salem
                and married 1) Joshua Conant who was the son of Roger
                Conant. Their son married a daughter of Richard More.
                When Joshua died, she married 2) John Grafton. One of
                their descendants is John Albion Andrew who was the 25th
                Governor of Massachusetts (1861-1866).<small><sup>6</sup></small>
