            12/15/2020 -- We have several blogs and will get one
            established with respect to technical modes and methods. In
            the meantime, we'll post here (or <a

            <br>
            <br>
            09/15/2020 -- We're to the mode of reviewing based upon the
            experiences of the past few months, some of which has been
            heavily into the user mode in various types of situations.
            See <a href="demo.html">TGSoc Discussion</a>. <br>
            <br>
            07/09/2019 -- We are broadening our technical view to allow
            the more recent frameworks to have a play in our minimal
            approach to configuration management. At the same time,
            we'll be adjusting content to meet the new capability. The '<a

              stuff</a>' post will be the main source portal while we
            work until we establish a more permanent one. Next up,
            expect some management scheme to appear that can be used to
            manage work related to the Thomas Gardner Society, Inc.
            mission, including technical (they go hand in hand), with <a
              href="https://trello.com">Trello.com</a> as an enabler. <br>
            <br>
            06/02/2019 -- I'll put this at the top, after a little
            reorg. But, here is a link to our What's New at two sites (<a
              href="https://thomasgardnersociety.org/html/whatsnew.html">main






              site</a> and <a
              href="https://thomasgardnerofsalem.blogspot.com/p/what-is-new.html">context






              blog</a>). Sometimes, these are in sync; other times, not.
            Too, we have a <a
href="http://thomasgardnerofsalem.wordpress.com/2014/11/16/verbosity-or-sparsity-or/">technology






              blog</a> that is moving to be under our own server. <br>
            <br>
            06/01/2019 -- In the past couple months, we finished off the
            js use, for now. The menu is handled by js. There is now a
            scrolling text window. It refreshes (using an annals look at
            Thomas Gardner) with each page load (will have scroll).
            Then, we have the image index that is approaching 200
            entries that map either to blog entries or to Gardner Beacon
            issues. This allowed a review of publications to date. Too,
            it helped set up for future activities, such as supporting
            the 400th anniversaries that are upcoming. Mayflower started
            this year and will be going big in 2020. Cape Ann is
            expected to be in 2023. In continuing to build on our
            minimal approach, we are bringing in eCommerce (eBiz)
            functions. Right now, I am looking at CubeCart which is
            interesting. As well, the technical blog will be moved from
            Wordpress to be under our website (based upon Linux).
            Briefly, it is nice to see that the Open approaches support
            the file framework. Essentially, the admin effort is editing
            source code using an advanced editor rather than poking
            buttons, only. Will have more on this, as have worked in
            WikiTree for a while and really like that the 'wiki'
            approach is similar. With CubeCart, I can monkey with the
            source to make specific changes, albeit I have to be
            careful. <br>
            <br>
            03/27/2019 -- The exercise has been to remove tables and to
            have mobile friendliness across browsers, though only
            checking the major ones, to date (Chrome, Mosaic). I had no
            problem <a
              href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_images_side_by_side.asp">floating








              images</a> to get them side by side, but the general 'div'
            proved problematic, for several reasons. So, went looking.
            Saw various approaches describe and chose <a
href="https://medium.com/@patrickbrosset/demystifying-css-alignment-2d3ea7a02a36">to








              go with flexbox</a>. Nice, but not easy to control. So, on
            looking more to see what I was missing with use of 'flex', I
            ran across <a
href="https://benfrain.com/easier-user-interface-and-responsive-layouts-using-css-tables/">CSS








              Tables</a>. Ah. That does it. Remember, the goal is to be
            as minimal as possible while having access to lots of
            information. As soon as I feel comfortable with that, we'll
            start to get away from presentation solely and work into a
            more interactive mode (minimally). One way to do that is to
            have the user branch over to another site. We'll see. <br>
            <br>
            03/20/2019 -- When I started to use Sea Monkey's Composer in
            2012, it cut out nice HTML. From time to time, I grunge'd
            about the excess white space in the HTML stream but lived
            with it. Now, with the <a href="https://tgsoc.org">TGSoc.org</a>
            site, I have been trying to have a minimal basis upon which
            we'll build features. But, I've noticed that somewhere along
            the line, all sorts of pieces related to format have crept
            into the HTML stream. Messy, to say the least. So, if you
            saw a half-done link, it is because I have switched to
            manually building the HTML. And, it was late. I never
            noticed when I pushed up the change. Let's say that it sat
            there for 16 hours, now corrected. The changes were done
            with a simple text editor. I am looking for an editor that
            puts out clean HTML. As well, there is a link to a text
            scroll page that will display from the timeline published in
            The Gardner Annals, Volume I, Number 1. Too, I am removing
            tables. So, it's also a CSS and JS exercise. The
            capabilities that we will introduce relate to going from
            information presentation to interaction needed for group
            work as well as e-commerce. Decisions are pending through
            the whole of the change effort.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            01/27/2019 -- Using 'hidden div' to pass parms from HTML to
            js. There have been several different approaches created
            over the years in the industry. Will review these at some
            point and look at pros and cons. In the mean time, this
            approach will be used to re-format the <a
              href="https://thomasgardnersociety.org/">main site</a>. At
            the same time, the CSS can be cleaned up a bit, as both
            sites follow a similar structure. <br>
            <br>
            01/25/2019 -- Put in the first js handling of the menu bar
            at the top level. It shows something that needs to be
            discussed. In fact, we need to deconstruct the whole of the
            current approach in order to make a better future for all of
            the people (as in, all, not just the few). <br>
            <br>
            01/21/2019 -- Image index handling now using the element
            approach. Hence, no 'document.write' on this site (that I
            know of - this one is where we check out new approaches for
            ourselves). The main site will be updated. Next up, handling
            the menu bar via JavaScript. Last night, watched a little of
            the video from Nov. 2018's meeting. Interesting
            developments. <br>
            <br>
            01/20/2019 -- See <a
              href="file:///C:/Users/JMSwtlk/Documents/websites/TGSoc/demo/demo.html">Configuration















              discussion</a>. The footer at this site has been changed
            to use 'innerHTML' instead of 'document.write' as Chrome
            kept complaining about deprecation which it is not given our
            focus on book-like. However, since we have started to add
            other services, we have to go dynamic, in part. We'll
            upgrade the image handler and the menus. Then, we'll launch
            into more spectacular stuff. <br>
            <br>
            01/04/2019 -- Decided to bite the bullet and redo the image
            list with javascript. A recent ACM Communications article
            talked some of the issues of SQL versus noSQL that was
            interesting to read. As, I have done both. Frankly, I have
            bounced off some heavily SQL-oriented approaches of late (in
            this context of configuration versus content). In the list,
            I was using HTML to format, albeit I had also used CSS for a
            lot of the other requirements. So, each entry required
            copying and modifying. Using the noSQL mindset, the first
            thing was to&nbsp; reduce the list to a pair where the blog
            entry was the keyword (temporal, partly) with the image as
            value. I had thought that I would automate the conversion.
            Turned out, with a good text editor, I cut the list to size
            (same number of entries, reduced amount of text per entry)
            in a matter of minutes; of course, trying a few variations.
            Then, the writing the HTML code was one-line within a loop
            since I could have a few strings, some with special
            characters embedded, concatenated. Moving the format control
            to CSS cut that part, too. So, look at the Main page. Now,
            it'll be easier to add entries which will be many. That, of
            course, brings us back to content versus configuration
            (coding is here).&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            12/26/2018 -- <a

              mobile</a> (2014/5 timeframe) is an example of a
            technology push. In this case, Google spread the word that
            they would not refer their search-engine users to sites that
            were not mobile friendly. That gave us a change to relook at
            alternatives including starting over. We decided to go with
            HTML/CSS due to its ability to minimize code. Basically, you
            are dealing the parametrics. We will be adding code, as we
            had with javascripting.<br>
            <br>
            11/25/2018 -- Got a chance to view this site (tgsoc.org) on
            a mobile device. Looked good. That is, 'mobile' of a the
            smaller variety as I have been accessing the site daily via
            my laptop browser. <br>
            <br>
            10/20/2018 -- So, we had the 2010 start, then the 2012
            rehost, then the 2014 upgrade, then the 2016 adjust (notice
            how everyone is trying to support the mobile devices?), and
            now the 2018 advance. That is, now we will consider
            frameworks for ERP, accounting, and what have you. During
            the time, we looked at various other approaches, such as
            those provided by WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and more. Also,
            we did try a blackboard which, incidentally, is used by
            millions daily. Our approach? Simplistic and trustworthy
            evolution of capability. Let the mad world run amok as it
            may.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>

              page</a>, scrolling was not working right. Some of the
