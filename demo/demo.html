            which is XII, 2 goes into the activity for this year. There
            were two main themes, technology and its impact on our
            records. Namely, for that second, changes necessary to
            adjust to the baptismal record finding. All the children but
            Seeth were born in the old country. So, that delays the
            arrival time. But, was Thomas Gardner as we were researching
            a conflation of two individuals? Don't know yet. The site
            will be modified to consider that Thomas Gardner and family
            arrived in Salem sometime before Seeth was born. So that
            would be the early 1630s. There is another Thomas Gardner to
            research (see the WikiTree writeup on this). Now, with
            regard to technology, we are setting up to argue that the
            former work in knowledge (expert) systems is very much
            needed to firm up the current situation. Not only was it
            effective in the past, projects have continued over the
            years. Say tuned for this. With respect to what is new, we
            intend to utilize the "pilot" facilities this year in an
            experimental fashion. Results will be posted. Always, see
            our <a moz-do-not-send="true"

            <b><br>
              Note (09/16/2023):</b> Wait, that was a little premature.
            The focus to that last bullet was on how web presence might
            be better handled. Still goes, folks. My favorite
            mathematical site is sill there and in use on the subject of
            mathematical physics. I have seen plenty of other good
            example. As opposed to, say, those over-complicated site
            with more noise than message. Arg. So, now, a mere month
            after the last bullet, Nov of 2022, OpenAI released their
            ChatGpt system upon the world. We did not pay
            attention&nbsp; until Feb of 2023. Our first attempt at the
            system was captured in a post (<a moz-do-not-send="true"

              ChatGPT</a>) which is funny, as soon after we found out
            that Thomas Gardner may have not been at Cape Ann in
            1623/24. But, then, he may have been. It's an open issue. In
            any case, we started discussion with our colleagues at
            Sperry Univac's Knowledge System Center which was operating
            in the 1980s and have made several determinations that need
            to be written up. For one thing, AI is much more than ML/DL
            (and all of its variants). As well, people are the key here
            and will require more of a focus. Stay tuned. This will be
            technical. For now, we are collecting position papers at the
            portal: <a moz-do-not-send="true"

            Larry Walker goes back the early days of computing where he
            applied his degree in mathematics to system design and
            testing at Control Data and Univac. He rose in management to
            be head of systems development for Univac's major computer
            systems. Later, his Knowledge Systems Center pioneered
            commercial use of AI (with the expert system focus). We will
            be tracing out the history of AI from the non-academic
            viewpoint, bringing to fore work long ignored.&nbsp; &nbsp;

            <br>
            <b>Note (10/07/2022):</b> Final technical note, after
            looking at Concrete CMS and Drupal. These were considered
            earlier and have progressed as has WordPress. And, each of
            the three has solid use by well-known customers who have
            access to talent. As we work our configuration, we will be
            looking more than slightly at the issues which is best done
            with multiple parties to inspect. Say, like the infamous
            flyoff when new technology is being assessed. This type of
            thing is going to be even harder for computing. That is,
            bridging the cognitive gaps (or hats). Our put is called
            truth engineering. The ability to think at bare metal went
            away with the newer methods (we can recover). Is there some
            equivalence? Too, the internet's evolution can now be seen
            more readily given the experiences of the last half decade
            (and a little more). For instance, we can point to one paper
            discussing Concrete CMS versus WordPress, from the viewpoint
            of the former. It shows the flexible, parametric approach.
            Then, we have what we call <b>AI</b>n't coming forth. What
            we have here is mathematics and parameters mixing in an
            unlimited number of ways. WordPress, Concrete CMS, and
            Drupal represent parametric modes that are phenomenally
            complicated. The potential error are covered over. We'll
            explain. And so, we have the situation where there is no
            human talent with the evolutionary wherewithal to handle the
            issues, except as a guider of the <b>AI</b>n't ways, if
            they are done correctly. ... It's almost like we've stood
            still the past decade and one-half with lots and lots of
            noise being added. Where is the value if only marketing is
            thought to be the major player? Tsk. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note (10/06/2022):</b> Over the past few days, we got the
            old sites in sync with each other: Portal (this one), the
            legacy site, and our tech blog (here with the tech
            subdirectory). Then, we started a site subdirectory here at
            which to develop and test our new configuration with
            WordPress as the backbone helping with the flow of all of
            the rest as they process content and its presentation. So,
            see <a moz-do-not-send="true"

            the current portal front page which we will reconfigure as
            the first step and then work through all of the other
            accumulation over eleven years plus. The theme is content
            vis-a-vis configuration.&nbsp; <br>

            choices which are many. Lots of levels, plus new stuff
            (AIn't). Say, app or not; simple or hugely complicated; and
            more. In the meantime, we'll use WordPress for mobile's
            sake. <a moz-do-not-send="true"

            <b>Note (07/21/2022):</b> Time flies for old folks; it drags
            for the younger. Which is better? In the earlier age
            experiences, there are demands, almost unceasing. The
            pressures of work and accomplishment loom large for most,
            for one thing. Then, there are the unknowns for any who is
            not following some predetermined path, say those put forth
            by one's ancestors, especially those of the immediate
            generation. But, even then, times change, too; we see lots
            of shuffling twixt generational views. What constants can we
            observe over time? Well, the upcoming 250th is an example.
            There has been much written about this event over the years,
            mosty by professionals. Now, with technology we will see the
            human touch, via family stories and such. So, to perturb
            that, we now have another factor. The artificial, in terms
            of this thing that we can call <b>AI</b>n't that gets a lot
            of press and attention. People have lots of questions that
            have been unanswered. In short, though, the gist of the
            matter is that a convergence of abilities of humans and
            computers has set the stage for comparisons as were not
            available before. Too, we see more mathematics available in
            a broader sense due to computational mathematics. The recent
            Turing award by the ACM was to a guy who has worked in
            mathematical library development and maintenance over the
            years. John has had that focus, too. So, the imaginations
            gone wild as we see with claims about <b>AI</b>n't really
            can be attributed to observational modes that are out of
            balance due to several factors that we can handle. And,
            will. It's our future. That is, we the people, society, and
            the TGS, Inc. in particular. We can use the Gairdner Group's
            (of Canada) focus on biomedical issues over the past few
            decades as an example. We are claiming that we can weigh in
            on the artificial by using knowledge from people over time.
            This knowledge referenced here comes from historical studies
            that touch upon all subjects, from more than a philosophical
            view. Computational prowess? Yes, it is real. Meta (and
            Zuck) are quite valid in a sense; are they sound (different
            sense)? Another issue. We have our work cut out for us. But,
            then, so do the rest of humanity. One question, who can lead
            in truth engineering?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

            <b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b>Note (03/09/2022):</b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>
            We have been paying close attention to the technology of
            software especially those things going under the guise of AI
            (which we are calling <b>AI</b>n't). In October, we had a
            post about <a moz-do-not-send="true"

              dumb AI</a> might be. What is being done is an one-trick
            pony type of thing, so we will be getting more into that. In
            January, we looked at <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://thomasgardnerofsalem.blogspot.com/2022/01/current-challenge.html">Harvard's




















              view</a> while discussing technology as our focus. At that
            same time, we began a study of U.S. History with Harvard as
            a prime thread which has turned up some interesting
            information. Back to the content vs configuration theme.
            Those topics are on the content side. The configuration
            studies continue with a different type of technology under
            observation. We will use going to a mobile mode as the means
            to work out some open issues. In terms of service, we expect
            to offer these via a shared server mode. Some argue for the
            cloud. Any of those wrap you into their handcuffs. We will
            revisit some work done back in 2012. Right now, from that
            work, we expect to dive deeper into Drupal and WordPress.
            So, plenty to do. ... Since November of 2021, we have had a
            mobile device which allowed us to catch up. Mostly, we puke
            for some of the choices made that were imposed on the rest
            of by the elite of computing; expect that our technology
            status (the whole of it) will be a daily part of our being,

            With respect to the roll your own, that still applies.
            However, we found out that <a

              at DAR.org</a> was done using Drupal which we looked at
            earlier (we will pull our notes). In fact, we did a demo
            using the resource. We did our own plus pushed out demos of
            three packages. Guess what? One was hacked. Drupal. So, we
            dropped that one, then. But, they look tighter now. Also,
            the mobile world has caused lots of changes. A fact? We are
            only now getting smartphones (5G is causing our old flip
            phones to become unusable - oh well - technically, they are
            still going after 16 years - they were the roughed type that
            a firetruck could run over). All along, we have maintained
            our data in JS and text. And, HTML/CSS, of course, for the
            major handler. Looking forward to doing some real digital

            and preparing for the next. Several changes are on the
            horizon. We will put a tip jar on the site to encourage
            support. This portal itself will be reconfigured somewhat as
            will the main site. This particular page was started to
            trace our technical activity. As such, it will be put into a
            more current, archive framework. We have several examples

            which is encouraging to see. One thing to note, our focus is
            substance and not flash. BTW, DARPA, itself, is now
            realizing that they have to establish a way to handle a
            100-year program view. Yes, sustainable methods are one key.
            There is more. And, so, given our interest in truth
            engineering, we will use the Thomas Gardner Society, Inc.
            work to facilitate anything to do with preserving for the
            future which includes, definitely, more than a short-term
            viewpoint. Also, working on a 'tip jar' as starters for

            <b><b>Note (09/15/2020): </b></b>The past couple of
            quarters, we have been in a user mode where we could see
            technology in action and learn about what to bitch when
            things were done stupidly. And so, we'll get to this, again.
            The older discussions will be pushed down but accessible. Up
            front will be heavy looking at Spinoza's Ethics to pull out
            lessons for our computational age. You know, Spinoza and
            Descartes were cohorts on the planet with Thomas and his
            peers over here. That's interesting. Our focus, for a while,
            has been using the whole of the 400 years of history as a
            means to understand current situations and choice options.
            About a decade and one-half ago, there was a disturbance
            (will not disruption, at that whole theory is wrong, people)
            that went along with a schizoid way of computing. That is,
            the larger modes of old which are still around below the
            cover and being harped about in terms of legacy slowly
            giving way to the personal which really took off with IP's
            TCP was let loose with other capabilities that we, the US
            Taxpayers, funded over the years. About five years ago,
            there was some type of maturity being demonstrated by the
            personal side (so-called smart phone) which now has morphed
            to a hand-held computer for which telephony is a secondary
            concern (pushed to a card). Needless to say, for delivery of
            capability, that looks promising, albeit there are limits of
            concern (and not just talking battery - nope, let's get to
            the essence of computing). ... Jumping over coming
            discussion, let's say that our technical focus is back (<a

            <blockquote><b>Discussion:</b> We are now twenty plus years
              into the web (WWW) and have seen ubiquitous solutions in
              about every corner of human activity. Mobile devices
              provide power rivaling desktop workstations (even that of
              compute servers).&nbsp; 'Embedded' has entire new
              definitions and examples pending; reminder: this approach
              has been around for a long time, and pre-existed the
              Internet. HTTP enabled advances far beyond what was
              expected. But, with the evolution, one can trace the
              problems that arose, some of which were foreseen or could
              have been given the effort. One huge change was that
              requirements, which had been central to computer system
              development, lost its punch as a throw-out and respond to
              criticisms (and failures) became the vogue. Quick releases
              carried lots of risk that many times came to fruition; we
              are lucky that it was not much worse (as we seen has
              happened with social media's promise of maximum chaos).
              But the form followed the functionality that has increased
              without bounds, it seems. Just the simple configuration of
              HTML/CSS/JS has changed tremendously. This triad is
              mentioned as it will be the focus and tool for the start
              of the necessary work which has not been defined. Rather,
              we need to look at the situation and try to settled on
              what is to be done. There are good examples, such as the <a
                href="https://plato.stanford.edu/">Stanford Encyclopedia
                of Philosophy</a> which has clean and elegant look as
              well as fulfilling a huge commitment with regard to
              content of a superior nature. Examples, on the other side,
              can be found with any of the extremely managed site of
              commercialized mayhem and, perhaps, other sites whose
              intent is to lure (evoke reaction). In between is an
              endless, and growing, set of examples. And, we will pull
              some of these together (<a href="scroll_options.html">first

                Mission</a>) starts with the Mayflower era and the
              people/events outside of Plymouth and, even, beyond the
              borders of Massachusetts. It traverses the whole of the
              U.S. history (covering all cultural levels and geographic
              regions) through the long centuries to now, with its
              social media. Along the way, we will look at people and
              their families who have endured and helped resolve the
              conflicts of which humans are so prone. Families? Yes,
              descendants, by blood and meme, who have thousands of
              families that they can look back to, and, in fact, ought
              to be allowed to without the contrivances of technology's
              purveyors getting in the way. How to do that? We have, on
              the one side, non-profits (like us) who want to do it
              right; on the other, we have monetarily driven attempts to
              corner markets. In between is the truth of the matter
              (sound familiar?). Computing and technology are central;
              too, though, are human talents not even addressed as of
              this time? So, the theme, right now, is to try to
              establish some way of working that spans the time, the
              activities, and the social aspects while honoring human
              intelligence and respecting rights proposed as essential
              by that later crowd of guys to pranced around
              Philadelphia. As, we have, to boot, the 800th of the Magna
              Carta as a a reminder of our past which document's purpose
              still applies (we need a modification for STEM and more).

            <b>Requirement:</b> We started our site on Microsoft's

              - March 2012</a>). So, I went looking for web hosts plus
            did a survey of the approaches of the time. I settled on Hub
            (Linux, etc.). And, steered away from the heavy database
            usage. Hence, I had to build my site by hand, meaning HTML
            (so, I dropped back to about 2000). Also, we had our look
            established. I snapped images off of the site and built an
            interface using these. The color and layout is close to what
            we had on OfficeLive. But, the idea was to have enough to
            keep working. The left image shows the state of the system,
            at that time. OfficeLive allowed an asp-based website
            configurator which I used. After all, the intent was <a

            Quite frankly, the whole notion seemed to be loose structure
            supported by database entries. That is, build the page on
            the fly. Later, I looked at frameworks and tried a few
            (Drupal, Concrete5, Joomla, and more), including Wordpress (<a

              blog</a>). Of late, I see that bootstrapping has come a
            long way. That might be interesting. <br>
            <br>
            But, it gets back to the decision about buy versus build.
            Or, off the shelf, whether free or not, which ties one into
            the work of others versus roll-your-own. Since I am looking
            for simple, doing something that way looks appealing,
            especially if it ties in with trying to show how to learn
            coding. There are pros and cons for either choice. With the
            cloud, people are getting even more remote from their stuff.
            I, at least, can log into the host that is being access from
            the web. Too, files are more than a metaphor. The
            unstructured database can be a problem. Balance is
            important. <br>
            <br>
            Leaving these types of decisions to academics might provide
            something useful. Rather, though, we see the large vendors
            establishing the protocols and what have you. In fact,
            things have changed so much in the rush forward, one has to
            wonder if we need to step back and look at things. But, that
            is getting ahead of ourselves. We want to show those who do
            not know code, or fear it, that they can learn, enough to
            know what is going on with these decisions and their
            discussions. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Advancements:</b> We have been stepwise through several
            advances. But, some pending improvements finally make sense.
            Why? Manual work is fine until scaling becomes an issue. So,
            we are there, finally, after trudging along for awhile. Our
            intent all along has been to add fa<img
              src="../images/new2.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="174"
              align="right">cilities to the newer format. Of late, we
            added an image index that provided links to content through
            the years. This approach uses simple CSS extensions that
            support scrolling with simple container definitions and the
            ability to float. The footer used some javascript. But,
            there is a lot more to do.&nbsp; The trouble is that one
            needs frameworks. And there are plenty of these. Of course,
            one might grow one's own. I have done plenty of that; but,
            there is too much to do to just sit around and have fun
            hacking code. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Editor/IDE:</b> The tool set requirement is minimal. For
            editing HTML (in a WYSIWYG fashion), I use Sea Monkey's
            Composer. Otherwise, one can edit HTML files with any
            editor, say Wordpad. Same goes for CSS or JSS. What brings
            more power would be the workbench tools that come with a
            browser. And, any of these will allow writes within the code
            to go to a console which can be used to watch the computer
            do its thing. <br>
            <br>
            The industry has evolved several IDEs which are development
            environments. They get complicated real fast. Doesn't
            everything? But, as my simple little website shows, one can
            do work and still not need complexity. That will come on its
            own. It's like pushing a wheelbarrow versus have a little
            bobcat do work. Would you believe that I can point to a
            post-Doc biology moving dirt by hand? Lots of it. &nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            One of the hardest thing about code is that everything has
            to be specified. And, in the distributed world, finding the
            particular source for a value can be extremely difficult.
            CSS allows local overrides. With JS, one controls the
            environment, to an extent. But, your code may be dependent
            upon some other bit of code. Other than that, though, it is
            open. <br>
            <br>
            Exercise to find where things are defined and why are always
            worth doing. CSS is a huge parametric system that gets
            larger by time. But, it also is quite capable (there is a 3D
            graphic engine written this way). And, CSS is like a
            database, too. One writes the CSS statements that will be
            subsumed with in a HTML file and presented to a browser. In
            short, this is coding albeit a high-level type. Note please,
            that plenty argue that we ought to be working at this level,
            anyway, due to complications that arise. <br>
            <br>
            So, we will do some structure changes with code using CSS
            and JS. Too, we'll pick up existing examples and modify
            them. Lots of them. That is, coding is never tabula raza.
            After all, lots of stuff has already been done. And, reuse
            is something to be respected. One can take any page
            presented on a browser and look at specifics. <br>
            <br>
            In a sense, this is 'computing for peasants' which is not
            derogatory. Let's say, not ivory towered. Top-down versus
            bottom-up will apply, always does. But, we can teach people
            to know how to open up and look at what is flowing on the
            web; it would be part of a truth engineering outlook. <br>

              bullet. It became too cumbersome to add entries, manually.
              So, reduced the string for the write by pushing more
              control to CSS. Then, cut the text by removing duplication
              (most of the link's URL). After that, a list with a pair
              for each entity, was nicely dense. A simple loop around a
              little string manipulation did the trick. Further? Since
              we want to get to search and filter, there will be some
              generalization. Buy off the shelf? What, and not have fun?

              our web pages have been, for the most part, thought of as
              building toward a book that included hyperlinks. As such,
              pages were mostly static except for things related to the
              mouse, such as 'hover.' Then, we could use SeaMonkey's
              editor plus some textual editors and worry about Content
              (see above). Too, we just pushed up via FTP from our local
              server to WebHostingHub. Early on, we had only HTML, with
              a footer script for 'date modified' added in once we got
              to HTML/CSS. You know how tedious it is to go through
              pages and change notices based upon years? All along,
              there was the intent to build further. And, not go off the
              shelf (a whole discussion that must be had - at some
              point). So, recently, we put in a 'image index' using
              adaptive techniques which are required for mobile. I do
              not have one yet but looked at this site recently and
              liked that the browser wars have settled down. That effort
              helped with maintaining the images. But, Chrome kept
              complaining when I was in the 'development tools' area
              about 'document.write' (which is still valid to use in the
              static mode). Well, on looking further, there is one war
              now about how to replace this facility. Given our thrust,
              we never had a problem. To make this short, the decision
              was to go with elements and properties (innerHTML). That
              has already been done for the footer for this site. The
              'main' site has not been reconfigured yet. We intend to
              write about all of this as we start to bring in other
              modifications. <br>

              rushes along in a lock-step. At each of the decision
              points that we are documenting and discussing, there were
              options based upon the current state of the art. Well,
              mobile apps that came in post 2008 have really changed in
              tone as the concept of services and resources to meet
              these evolved. For good mobile apps, there are
              corresponding views of web apps that require only a
              browser. Our main work entry has been via a laptop with
              simulation being used to assess mobility and such. We are
              about to step into the distributed world of apps where we
              handle any type of platform. BTW, this site represents a
              minimal 'roll your own' bit of capability sufficient to
              handle what we needed so far. Of course, we have a stack
              of new requirements to look at. However, we can continue
              in this mode and bring in new features in a stable manner.
              The main problem is trying to figure how to do this
              minimally as there are a whole lot of options with no
              clear winner. We'll have some commentary in this post: <a
