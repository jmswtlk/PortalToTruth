              New current</a>. As of today, we are finishing out 2020
            and preparing for the next. Several changes are on the
            horizon. We will put a tip jar on the site to encourage
            support. This portal itself will be reconfigured somewhat as
            will the main site. This particular page was started to
            trace our technical activity. As such, it will be put into a
            more current, archive framework. We have several examples
            that have come up that agree with what we had plann<a

            which is encouraging to see. One thing to note, our focus is
            substance and not flash. BTW, DARPA, itself, is now
            realizing that they have to establish a way to handle a
            100-year program view. Yes, sustainable methods are one key.
            There is more. And, so, given our interest in truth
            engineering, we will use the Thomas Gardner Society, Inc.
            work to facilitate anything to do with preserving for the
            future which includes, definitely, more than a short-term
            viewpoint. Also, working on a 'tip jar' as starters for
            handling read access and membership privileges.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <b><b>Note (09/15/2020): </b></b>The past couple of
            quarters, we have been in a user mode where we could see
            technology in action and learn about what to bitch when
            things were done stupidly. And so, we'll get to this, again.
            The older discussions will be pushed down but accessible. Up
            front will be heavy looking at Spinoza's Ethics to pull out
            lessons for our computational age. You know, Spinoza and
            Descartes were cohorts on the planet with Thomas and his
            peers over here. That's interesting. Our focus, for a while,
            has been using the whole of the 400 years of history as a
            means to understand current situations and choice options.
            About a decade and one-half ago, there was a disturbance
            (will not disruption, at that whole theory is wrong, people)
            that went along with a schizoid way of computing. That is,
            the larger modes of old which are still around below the
            cover and being harped about in terms of legacy slowly
            giving way to the personal which really took off with IP's
            TCP was let loose with other capabilities that we, the US
            Taxpayers, funded over the years. About five years ago,
            there was some type of maturity being demonstrated by the
            personal side (so-called smart phone) which now has morphed
            to a hand-held computer for which telephony is a secondary
            concern (pushed to a card). Needless to say, for delivery of
            capability, that looks promising, albeit there are limits of
            concern (and not just talking battery - nope, let's get to
            the essence of computing). ... Jumping over coming
            discussion, let's say that our technical focus is back (<a

            <blockquote><b>Discussion:</b> We are now twenty plus years
              into the web (WWW) and have seen ubiquitous solutions in
              about every corner of human activity. Mobile devices
              provide power rivaling desktop workstations (even that of
              compute servers).&nbsp; 'Embedded' has entire new
              definitions and examples pending; reminder: this approach
              has been around for a long time, and pre-existed the
              Internet. HTTP enabled advances far beyond what was
              expected. But, with the evolution, one can trace the
              problems that arose, some of which were foreseen or could
              have been given the effort. One huge change was that
              requirements, which had been central to computer system
              development, lost its punch as a throw-out and respond to
              criticisms (and failures) became the vogue. Quick releases
              carried lots of risk that many times came to fruition; we
              are lucky that it was not much worse (as we seen has
              happened with social media's promise of maximum chaos).
              But the form followed the functionality that has increased
              without bounds, it seems. Just the simple configuration of
              HTML/CSS/JS has changed tremendously. This triad is
              mentioned as it will be the focus and tool for the start
              of the necessary work which has not been defined. Rather,
              we need to look at the situation and try to settled on
              what is to be done. There are good examples, such as the <a
                href="https://plato.stanford.edu/">Stanford Encyclopedia
                of Philosophy</a> which has clean and elegant look as
              well as fulfilling a huge commitment with regard to
              content of a superior nature. Examples, on the other side,
              can be found with any of the extremely managed site of
              commercialized mayhem and, perhaps, other sites whose
              intent is to lure (evoke reaction). In between is an
              endless, and growing, set of examples. And, we will pull
              some of these together (<a href="scroll_options.html">first


















                example</a>). <br>
              <br>
              <b>Overview:</b> This is a saga related to life, humanity,
              society, technology, science and the gamut. Notice the
              sponsoring organization. Essentially, it deals with
              activity over 400 years. That is, the view (<a
                href="http://thomasgardnersociety.org/html/aboutus.html">our


















                Mission</a>) starts with the Mayflower era and the
              people/events outside of Plymouth and, even, beyond the
              borders of Massachusetts. It traverses the whole of the
              U.S. history (covering all cultural levels and geographic
              regions) through the long centuries to now, with its
              social media. Along the way, we will look at people and
              their families who have endured and helped resolve the
              conflicts of which humans are so prone. Families? Yes,
              descendants, by blood and meme, who have thousands of
              families that they can look back to, and, in fact, ought
              to be allowed to without the contrivances of technology's
              purveyors getting in the way. How to do that? We have, on
              the one side, non-profits (like us) who want to do it
              right; on the other, we have monetarily driven attempts to
              corner markets. In between is the truth of the matter
              (sound familiar?). Computing and technology are central;
              too, though, are human talents not even addressed as of
              this time? So, the theme, right now, is to try to
              establish some way of working that spans the time, the
              activities, and the social aspects while honoring human
              intelligence and respecting rights proposed as essential
              by that later crowd of guys to pranced around
              Philadelphia. As, we have, to boot, the 800th of the Magna
              Carta as a a reminder of our past which document's purpose
              still applies (we need a modification for STEM and more).

            <b>Requirement:</b> We started our site on Microsoft's
            OfficeLive in 2010. A couple of years later, we saw the
            emergence of Office360 and decided to not go that route (<a

era


















              - March 2012</a>). So, I went looking for web hosts plus
            did a survey of the approaches of the time. I settled on Hub
            (Linux, etc.). And, steered away from the heavy database
            usage. Hence, I had to build my site by hand, meaning HTML
            (so, I dropped back to about 2000). Also, we had our look
            established. I snapped images off of the site and built an
            interface using these. The color and layout is close to what
            we had on OfficeLive. But, the idea was to have enough to
            keep working. The left image shows the state of the system,
            at that time. OfficeLive allowed an asp-based website
            configurator which I used. After all, the intent was <a

              management</a> not coding. I got thrown into website
            building when going off of asp. What to use? <br>

            Quite frankly, the whole notion seemed to be loose structure
            supported by database entries. That is, build the page on
            the fly. Later, I looked at frameworks and tried a few
            (Drupal, Concrete5, Joomla, and more), including Wordpress (<a
              href="https://thomasgardnerofsalem.wordpress.com/">technical


















              blog</a>). Of late, I see that bootstrapping has come a
            long way. That might be interesting. <br>
            <br>
            But, it gets back to the decision about buy versus build.
            Or, off the shelf, whether free or not, which ties one into
            the work of others versus roll-your-own. Since I am looking
            for simple, doing something that way looks appealing,
            especially if it ties in with trying to show how to learn
            coding. There are pros and cons for either choice. With the
            cloud, people are getting even more remote from their stuff.
            I, at least, can log into the host that is being access from
            the web. Too, files are more than a metaphor. The
            unstructured database can be a problem. Balance is
            important. <br>
            <br>
            Leaving these types of decisions to academics might provide
            something useful. Rather, though, we see the large vendors
            establishing the protocols and what have you. In fact,
            things have changed so much in the rush forward, one has to
            wonder if we need to step back and look at things. But, that
            is getting ahead of ourselves. We want to show those who do
            not know code, or fear it, that they can learn, enough to
            know what is going on with these decisions and their
            discussions. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Advancements:</b> We have been stepwise through several
            advances. But, some pending improvements finally make sense.
            Why? Manual work is fine until scaling becomes an issue. So,
            we are there, finally, after trudging along for awhile. Our
            intent all along has been to add fa<img
              src="../images/new2.jpg" alt="" height="174" align="right"
              width="245">cilities to the newer format. Of late, we
            added an image index that provided links to content through
            the years. This approach uses simple CSS extensions that
            support scrolling with simple container definitions and the
            ability to float. The footer used some javascript. But,
            there is a lot more to do.&nbsp; The trouble is that one
            needs frameworks. And there are plenty of these. Of course,
            one might grow one's own. I have done plenty of that; but,
            there is too much to do to just sit around and have fun
            hacking code. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Editor/IDE:</b> The tool set requirement is minimal. For
            editing HTML (in a WYSIWYG fashion), I use Sea Monkey's
            Composer. Otherwise, one can edit HTML files with any
            editor, say Wordpad. Same goes for CSS or JSS. What brings
            more power would be the workbench tools that come with a
            browser. And, any of these will allow writes within the code
            to go to a console which can be used to watch the computer
            do its thing. <br>
            <br>
            The industry has evolved several IDEs which are development
            environments. They get complicated real fast. Doesn't
            everything? But, as my simple little website shows, one can
            do work and still not need complexity. That will come on its
            own. It's like pushing a wheelbarrow versus have a little
            bobcat do work. Would you believe that I can point to a
            post-Doc biology moving dirt by hand? Lots of it. &nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            One of the hardest thing about code is that everything has
            to be specified. And, in the distributed world, finding the
            particular source for a value can be extremely difficult.
            CSS allows local overrides. With JS, one controls the
            environment, to an extent. But, your code may be dependent
            upon some other bit of code. Other than that, though, it is
            open. <br>
            <br>
            Exercise to find where things are defined and why are always
            worth doing. CSS is a huge parametric system that gets
            larger by time. But, it also is quite capable (there is a 3D
            graphic engine written this way). And, CSS is like a
            database, too. One writes the CSS statements that will be
            subsumed with in a HTML file and presented to a browser. In
            short, this is coding albeit a high-level type. Note please,
            that plenty argue that we ought to be working at this level,
            anyway, due to complications that arise. <br>
            <br>
            So, we will do some structure changes with code using CSS
            and JS. Too, we'll pick up existing examples and modify
            them. Lots of them. That is, coding is never tabula raza.
            After all, lots of stuff has already been done. And, reuse
            is something to be respected. One can take any page
            presented on a browser and look at specifics. <br>
            <br>
            In a sense, this is 'computing for peasants' which is not
            derogatory. Let's say, not ivory towered. Top-down versus
            bottom-up will apply, always does. But, we can teach people
            to know how to open up and look at what is flowing on the
            web; it would be part of a truth engineering outlook. <br>

              bullet. It became too cumbersome to add entries, manually.
              So, reduced the string for the write by pushing more
              control to CSS. Then, cut the text by removing duplication
              (most of the link's URL). After that, a list with a pair
              for each entity, was nicely dense. A simple loop around a
              little string manipulation did the trick. Further? Since
              we want to get to search and filter, there will be some
              generalization. Buy off the shelf? What, and not have fun?

              our web pages have been, for the most part, thought of as
              building toward a book that included hyperlinks. As such,
              pages were mostly static except for things related to the
              mouse, such as 'hover.' Then, we could use SeaMonkey's
              editor plus some textual editors and worry about Content
              (see above). Too, we just pushed up via FTP from our local
              server to WebHostingHub. Early on, we had only HTML, with
              a footer script for 'date modified' added in once we got
              to HTML/CSS. You know how tedious it is to go through
              pages and change notices based upon years? All along,
              there was the intent to build further. And, not go off the
              shelf (a whole discussion that must be had - at some
              point). So, recently, we put in a 'image index' using
              adaptive techniques which are required for mobile. I do
              not have one yet but looked at this site recently and
              liked that the browser wars have settled down. That effort
              helped with maintaining the images. But, Chrome kept
              complaining when I was in the 'development tools' area
              about 'document.write' (which is still valid to use in the
              static mode). Well, on looking further, there is one war
              now about how to replace this facility. Given our thrust,
              we never had a problem. To make this short, the decision
              was to go with elements and properties (innerHTML). That
              has already been done for the footer for this site. The
              'main' site has not been reconfigured yet. We intend to
              write about all of this as we start to bring in other
              modifications. <br>

              rushes along in a lock-step. At each of the decision
              points that we are documenting and discussing, there were
              options based upon the current state of the art. Well,
              mobile apps that came in post 2008 have really changed in
              tone as the concept of services and resources to meet
              these evolved. For good mobile apps, there are
              corresponding views of web apps that require only a
              browser. Our main work entry has been via a laptop with
              simulation being used to assess mobility and such. We are
              about to step into the distributed world of apps where we
              handle any type of platform. BTW, this site represents a
              minimal 'roll your own' bit of capability sufficient to
              handle what we needed so far. Of course, we have a stack
              of new requirements to look at. However, we can continue
              in this mode and bring in new features in a stable manner.
              The main problem is trying to figure how to do this
              minimally as there are a whole lot of options with no
              clear winner. We'll have some commentary in this post: <a
