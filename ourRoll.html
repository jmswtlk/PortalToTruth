                      Ann</a> crew led by Thomas Gardner<small><sup>1</sup></small>
                    in the 1623/24 time frame, there had been activity
                    in the region. Newfoundland had already been
                    established. There was the Plymouth colony. An
                    attempt had been made at Sagadahoc in modern Maine
                    before that.<sup>2</sup> Hence, there were local
                    fishermen. Cape Ann became a center for fish curing.
                    However, there were also crews coming from England.
                    They would spend a couple of months or so in
                    crossing the Atlantic. Then, they would fish. And,
                    dry their fish in preparation for the return trip.
                    "Every March small ships of between thirty and eight
                    tons, manned by crews of twenty to forty men and
                    boys ... carried salt, provisions, equipment.
                    Brought material for their boats. Took two months to
                    get here. Put their boats together and fished. Split
                    the work between fishing and salting. Filled the
                    hold and returned in autumn. Crews were gathered
                    yearly by the master. Principally young, fifteen to
                    twenty-five years old. Many were trying to get money
                    to get established in their home area."<sup>3</sup>
                    The idea behind the Dorchester Company created by
                    Rev. John White<sup>4</sup> was to have a settlement
                    with permanent residents who would ship produce
                    (fish and vegetable) back to the old country. Cape
                    Ann was a rocky cape and was not suitable for
                    farming, as the crew discovered.<sup>5</sup> <br>

                  began a commercial effort in the 1623/24 time frame.
                  This effort had been coordinated by Rev. John White<small><sup>2</sup></small>
                  and was to farm sufficiently to send produce back to
                  England. The plan also was to fish through the good
                  seasons and to send back dried fish. In prior years,
                  the round-trip requirement in one year cut down the
                  fishing time. In reality, it proved harder to fish
                  than expected. There had been many years of prior
                  fishing to give New England a good reputation. Too,
                  the soil was found to not be suitable for farming.
                  Further south, the Mayflower experience at Plymouth
                  demonstrated the difficulties that faced any
                  newcomers. The focus at Cape Ann moved to Naumkeag
                  which allowed for more success, with some glowing
                  reports being sent back to England.<small><sup>3</sup></small>
                  By 1630, there was enough interest generated for John
                  Winthrop<small><sup>4</sup></small> to lead a group of
                  ships packed with settlers. Hence started the Puritan
                  Great Migration.<small><sup>5</sup></small> We are 400
                  years past this event and will be looking across that
                  time span at the families and their fifteen some
                  generations of involvement with the 'American Dream.'<small><sup>6</sup></small>

                  They used Cape Ann for fish drying. A lot has been

                      establishing a colony, they found out quickly that
                      the terrain was not suitable for farming and that
                      the local waters did not produce much fish. The
                      crew was successful, though, at maintaining their
                      health by producing enough for their small crew.<small><sup>2</sup></small>
                      While England expected Roger Conant who came in
                      1625 to improve matters, this was not to be. Roger
                      got permission to move to Naumkeag. It is thought
                      that the group made landfall near Massey's Cove.<small><sup>3</sup></small>
                      Thomas is not recorded as going to Naumkeag. What
                      happened? Most likely, he and Margaret stayed at
                      Cape Ann with their kids in the house.<small><sup>4</sup></small>
                      When John Endicott came a little later, he saw
                      them enjoying the house. It was torn down and
                      moved over to what was then Salem (renaming of
                      Naumkeag) on orders of John.<small><sup>5</sup></small>

                      commercial effort that was to ship food back to
                      England. The other person in charge was John Tylly<small><sup>2</sup></small>
                      who had responsibility for the fishing. Neither of
                      the efforts were successful for reasons that we
                      will study. Roger Conant was sent to Cape Ann to
                      see if he could improve the situation but did not.<small><sup>3</sup></small>
                      A decision was made to move to a new area, called
                      Naumkeag, which became Salem.<small><sup>4</sup></small>
                      When the 300th anniversary was celebrated, a
                      pageant depicted this history.<small><sup>5</sup></small>
                      With the 400th coming up, we have several research
                      areas to attend to. One goal is to get Thomas, and
                      Margaret, more attention. Hence, we will research
                      the early day quite thoroughly.<small><sup>6</sup></small>
                      Oh yes, on the shipping of foodstuff? It did not
                      take long before New England was a prime exporter.

                      they were on their own. Since the colony was to
                      provide produce and fish, their tools were for
                      that purpose. Cape Ann was renowned for its
                      fishing.<small><sup>2</sup></small></font> Hence,
                    fishing crews from Plymouth had built structures for
                    drying fish in the area as they had regularly
                    visited the spot. The Dorchester crew brought the

                    It had an internal fireplace. Massachusetts is
                    fairly far north and can have severe winters. In
                    1607, a party landed in what is now Maine at Popham
                    and survived a winter with no casualties.<small><sup>5</sup></small>
                    Actually, they built a sea-going vessel while there
                    that they sailed to Virginia. Ingenuity was not
                    lacking. Not long after the successful establishment
                    in the Salem area where the Cape Ann party moved in
                    1626, more people began arriving than resources
